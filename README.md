# Purpose and Goal of Project:
The goal of this project is to provide as many autonomous capabilities as possible in a small form factor robot, controlled by a single Arduino Uno. The robot should be able to:
1. Maneuver its way to specific points on an x, y plane in relation to its starting position
2. Map its environment for more efficient motion planning
3. Pick up a block located in the general location of a given x, y coordinate
# Components:
This Robot was assembled using the following components:
